Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial 
linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label 
the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for 
generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding 
windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, 
was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency 
components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables 
from the time and frequency domain.  

Files prepared for the Course Progect:
